    "The `cursor` object is basically a context handle to a database. After we execute our `SELECT` statement, we want to retrieve the data. In this case, I knew there wasn't too many results to return, so I just retrieved them all by running `cursor.fetchall()`. This consumes all the results from the database using the handle. Most database handles are similar to a forward-only iterator, so running `cursor.fetchall()` twice will produce nothing the second time. In practice, it's usually better to use `cursor.fetchmany()` and repeat that until no more results are returned. You can also use `cursor.fetchone()` similarly."
