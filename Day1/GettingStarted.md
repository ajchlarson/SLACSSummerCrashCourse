# Getting Started

The lessons for the next 3 days will be shown in **jupyter notebooks**. Jupyter notebooks are
interactive computing enviornments. Jupyter notebooks render nicely online, so you can choose to just follow along [online](https://github.com/mclaughlin6464/SLACSummerCrashCourse).
However, we **strongly** reccomend you install a few things so you can interact with the notebooks yourself! Here's what you should do:

1. You should install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and *clone* this repository with the following command
  
    `git clone https://github.com/mclaughlin6464/SLACSummerCrashCourse.git`
    
2. You should install the following packages:

    * [Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html)
    * [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
    * [Putty](http://www.putty.org/) (if you're using a windows computer.)
    
If you have any trouble let us know. It's not essential that you have everything going right away, so just follow along online if you get stuck!
